    <p class="row justify">
      We at Fridge Raider look to solve the problem of not knowing what great recipes
      you could make from the random assortment of groceries that you have left in the
      fridge. We hope to present new and interesting recipes to our users, and promote
      a smart, and healthy lifestyle for all. We use Spoonacular's Food-API to make this
      all possible, as well as a few nifty programmer tricks that we picked up in Professor
      Marchiori's fullstack class at Bucknell University. This project was something that
      we felt passionate about, and would actually use ourselves when we aren't busy drinking
      coffee and writing code. It's a big problem for our generation, that we just don't like to
      cook, and would rather call in delivery. While a recipe might not have you competing on Iron
      Chef tomorrow, we think that websites like ours can help make cooking fun for the next generation.*
      In the future, we might like to add some functionaliy to this nifty recipe finding webapp, but there's
      only so much time in a semester to complete a big project like this one. We used AWS, MongoDB, EC2,
      and a whole bunch of other fancy web developer tools in making this site as great to use as possible.
      Of all of the projects we've completed at Bucknell, this one was definitely the most fun to complete,
      and we hope you enjoy it!
